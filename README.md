Airbnb Clone project (!Work in progress!)

The Frontend is build with **React**, **Redux toolkit** and **SCSS**.

This project also includes a Test Server set up with **NodeJS** and **Express**.

My goal with this project is to dive deeper into Web Development, 
expanding my knowledge and technical skills in the field. 
By engaging with a large-scale project like this, 
I push myself out of my comfort zone, 
where I will encounter new problems I haven't solved before
and have to make decisions regarding the project's structure.

This will teach me a lot and make me more prepared for a job as a Frontend Developer :)
